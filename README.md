# ETL_Project

Extraction

We used 2 datasets from the website: https://data.democratandchronicle.com/covid-19-vaccine-tracker/texas/bexar-county/48029/ and The Census Bureau CSV updated. All of our data was based on Bexar county. 


Transformation

Our first steps in cleaning up the datasets involved updating the most recent vaccine information from all Texas counties and transfering it from HTML to Dataframe Pandas. 
We also pulled updated Census Bureau CSV to incorporate updated positive case count numbers in Bexar county

Load

The last step was to transfer our final output into a Database. We created a database and respective tables to match the columns from the final Pandaâ€™s Data Frame using MYSQL and then connected to the database using SQLAlchemy and loaded the result. utilized PgAdmin
